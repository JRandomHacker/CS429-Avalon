# CS429-Avalon
**Description**

Our proposal is to create an online, playable, version of the Avalon expansion of the game Resistance. Avalon is a five to ten player, hidden roles game where the goal is for an informed minority to stop an uninformed majority from completing three missions successfully. Players will be able to vote on both teams and mission success, while viewing information about previous votes.
